# forty
Challenging myself to a 40 day streak of commits starting with 40 JS projects for beginners from the freeCodeCamp blog (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/)

In this repository I will attempt to make 40 consecutive days of commits and test my current understanding of JavaScript and Git fundamentals. 

Working through a list of 40 good JS projects from freeCodeCamp.org.

At end of either 40 days or the 40 projects I will reassess and either extend the project or move on to a similar continuous contribution goal. 

All projects in vanilla JS or React per project spec. 

I will attempt to accomplish each spec without using the tutorial or sample code first, and then add help as needed. 

One project per branch with sub branches as needed during development.

'main' is for Readme and other global repo documentation. Individual project branches will be pulled to main when functional.
