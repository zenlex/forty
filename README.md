# forty
Challenging myself to a 40 day streak of commits starting with 40 smaller JS projects from the freeCodeCamp blog (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/)

In this repository I will attempt to make 40 consecutive days of commits and test my current understanding of JavaScript and Git fundamentals. 

At end of either 40 days or the 40 projects I will either extend the project or move on to a similar continuous contribution goal. 

All projects in vanilla JS or React per project spec. 

Individual project readme files describe customizations and process. 

Project Kanban board utilized to triage issues and ideas for customization.
