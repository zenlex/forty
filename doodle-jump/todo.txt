Notes/Thoughts for improvement:

Turn doodler into class
Button for start game
replace all hard coded values with object properties (world object?)
separate components into an MVC structure? (If so, refactor out game engine also)
styling
Move doodler and platform to consistent coordinate space (relate everything to tops or to bottoms)
Refactor out collision detection
